|Duration             |Length of time the experiment has been ongoing up to the date the data are being reported for in years. In bimodal rainfall systems with multiple growing seasons, seasons are identified by fractions of the year, 0.5, etc. If outcomes are reported in a unimodal rainfall system with one growing season per year, the duration can be equivalent to one year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|M.Year               |The calendar year the measurement was taken. Seasons in multi-season systems are identified by decimals ‘.1’ or ‘.2’ for the first and second season respectively. When the measurements are average values for more than one year create a decimal for the years covered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|M.Year.Start         |First year the measurement was taken (YYYY). For yield or similar outcomes this should relate to the harvest year (rather than the planting year).

The EU for soil outcomes should be the crop(s) grown on the soil unless no crops are grown at all. Letters in the code should be lowercase. If the outcome refers to multiple experimental units (e.g. soil outcomes during an intercropping experiment) select all experimental units separated by a period (see EU2 tab).                                                                                                |
